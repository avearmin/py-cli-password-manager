# py-cli-password-manager
A command-line tool built with Python for securely managing passwords.

## Future Updates

Here are some planned features for the py-cli-password-manager project:

- **Password Creation:** Generate strong and unique passwords for each service or website to enhance security.
- **Password Storage:** Store passwords securely and encrypted to protect them from unauthorized access.
- **Password Retrieval:** Implement a convenient way to access passwords quickly.
- **Password Strength Detector:** Evaluate the strength of each password and provide recommendations for updating weak passwords.
- **Offline Storage:** Ensure that the password manager stores passwords locally offline to maintain privacy and reduce reliance on external services.

These features will provide users with a comprehensive password management solution that includes password strength assessment, secure storage, and the ability to store passwords locally offline.
